        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">MoneyTree - Calculator &middot; Warehouse 231 LLC &middot; Last Updated: February 20, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>MoneyTree - Calculator ("the App") is developed and operated by Warehouse 231 LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

        <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The App operates entirely on your device.</p>
        <p>Calculator inputs and saved scenarios are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data never leaves your device. We do not use analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs. We do not collect names, email addresses, location data, or device identifiers.</p>

        <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>MoneyTree offers optional subscription purchases ("Pro") through Apple's App Store. All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple. We do not have access to your payment information, credit card number, or Apple ID. For information about how Apple handles your purchase data, please refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any user data to third parties because we do not collect any user data.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All data created within the App (saved scenarios, calculator inputs) is stored locally on your device. If you delete the App, this data is permanently removed. We do not maintain servers or databases that store your information.</p>

        <h2>7. Export Feature</h2>
        <p>The App allows you to export calculator results as PDF, CSV, image, or text. These exports are generated locally on your device. When you choose to share an export, it is handled by your device's native share functionality. We do not receive or store any exported data.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
